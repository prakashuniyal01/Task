Task Overview

We want you to design and implement a backend for a payment gateway service. This task is designed to assess your system design skills, coding quality, and DevOps knowledge.

Requirements

1. System Design
Design a scalable and secure payment gateway service.
The service should handle different types of transactions (e.g., credit card, debit card, digital wallets).
Provide a detailed design document outlining your architecture. This should include:
High-level architecture diagram.
Database schema.
API design.
Data flow and interaction between different components.
Security measures (e.g., data encryption, authentication, and authorization).
2. Implementation
Develop the backend service using a language and framework of your choice (Node.js or Flask).
Ensure the service can handle basic CRUD operations related to payments.
Implement endpoints for:
Creating a payment.
Processing a payment.
Retrieving payment status.
Handling refunds.
Include error handling and logging mechanisms.
Integrate Swagger for API documentation. Your API should be documented with Swagger and accessible via a /docs endpoint.

3. DevOps
Containerize your application using Docker.
Write a Dockerfile to build your application.
Create a CI/CD pipeline using a tool of your choice (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
Deploy your application to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
Provide a link to the deployed application and API documentation.
Submission Guidelines
Code Repository: Share a link to your GitHub repository containing your project.
Documentation: Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run your application, as well as your design document.
Deployment: Provide the link to the live application and any credentials needed to test it.

Evaluation Criteria

Your task will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
System Design: Clarity and robustness of your architecture.
Code Quality: Readability, maintainability, and organization of your code.
Functionality: Completeness and correctness of the implemented features.
DevOps Skills: Effectiveness and efficiency of your CI/CD pipeline and deployment.

Looking forward to seeing your submission and wish you the best of luck!
